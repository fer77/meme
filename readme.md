# Create Your Own Memes

The purpose of this mini project was to put into practice the skills I had learned using jQuery.

### How To Create Your Memes

On the right side of the screen there are three input fields.</br>

![][create]</br>

Copy the image address you want to use and enter the the text where you would like it.  Is that easy.
